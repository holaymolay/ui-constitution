project_name: "cef-ui-constitution"
one_sentence_value_prop: "Machine-readable Visual Constitution that defines enforceable constraints for LLM-generated UI systems."
audience:
  include:
    - "Compiler and CI pipeline integrators who need deterministic visual rules."
    - "Frontend renderers that validate visual constraints before output."
  exclude:
    - "Teams looking for UI components or framework-specific tokens."
    - "Projects seeking prompts or agent workflows."
problem_statement: "Without enforceable constraints, LLM-generated UIs drift in style, violate accessibility floors, and become inconsistent across iterations."
solution_summary: "Publish a schema-governed constitution that encodes hard visual limits (typography, spacing, color, motion, assets) for deterministic validation."
outcomes:
  - "Provide JSON Schema documents for each visual domain with explicit bounds."
  - "Enable automated validation in CI and rendering pipelines."
  - "Define versioned, machine-enforceable rules with clear violation semantics."
quick_start:
  - "Read docs/purpose.md to understand scope and intent."
  - "Validate a constitution document against constitution/constitution.schema.json."
  - "Consult docs/enforcement-model.md for violation handling semantics."
